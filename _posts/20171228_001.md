#I have a website!

I'm pretty excited to say I now have a website (yay!).  I plan to post some of the following things on here:

* Solutions to Fivethirtyeight's Riddler columns.  They give me a good opportunity to practice some modelling. 

* Interesting thoughts on math, statistics, and data science.

*Updates on my career, academic or otherwise.

*Things to keep me motivated throughout all of this.  If you've ever done a graduate degree, you know how unmotivated you can get.
