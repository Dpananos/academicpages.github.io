"Bayesian Pharmacokinetics" is an opaque answer to the titular question. It
first assumes that you a) know what pharmacokinetics is, and b) know the
difference between Bayesian and Frequentist statistics.  This blog post is
not intended to fully discuss either of those problems in totality, but
rather give you a better idea about both of them by examining the work I do
for my Ph.D.

# A Motivating Problem

Imagine you are a doctor and a new patient has come into your clinic.  The
patient needs a blood thinner, but the go-to blood thinner has a track record
of being notoriously variable between patients.  By this, I mean given
two patients with the same age, height, weight, etc., two doses of the same size
taken at the same time could elicit very different blood serum concentrations in
the two patients.

That is a bit of a problem for drugs like Warfarin.  If the concentration of
Warfarin in your blood is too high, you risk suffering a bleed.  If it is too low,
it might not be an effective therapy.  It is crucial to get the dose right for
Warfarin as soon as possible so that it is an effective therapy but mitigates
risk of suffering a bleed.  What you're looking for is the dose size that will
get the concentration of Warfarin in the blood in this "Goldilocks" zone --
not too low, not too high, but just right.  This is the pharmacokinetic part
of Bayesian pharmacokinetics.  Knowing what the body does to the drug
(e.g. absorption, elimination, concentrations, etc.) is called "pharmacokinetics".

Given that the drug is highly variable between patients, how do you:

* best diagnose someone who just walked into your clinic?  

* Determine if your original dose size was right or wrong as effectively as possible and
course correct?  And, perhaps most importantly,

* Determine how confident you are in your decisions?

The answer to these questions will (hopefully) be the kernel of my thesis.
