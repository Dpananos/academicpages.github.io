"Bayesian Pharmacokinetics" is an opaque answer to the titular question. It
first assumes that you a) know what pharmacokinetics is, and b) know the
difference between Bayesian and Frequentist statistics.  This blog post is
not intended to fully discuss either of those problems in totality, but
rather give you a better idea about both of them by examining the work I do
for my Ph.D.

This is a work in progress.  I'll post bit by bit so that I don't get bored or frustrated.

# A Motivating Problem

Imagine you are a doctor and a new patient has come into your clinic.  The
patient needs a blood thinner, but the go-to blood thinner has a track record
of being notoriously variable between patients.  By this, I mean given
two patients with the same age, height, weight, etc., two doses of the same size
taken at the same time could elicit very different blood serum concentrations in
the two patients.

That is a bit of a problem for drugs like Warfarin.  If the concentration of
Warfarin in your blood is too high, you risk suffering a bleed.  If it is too low,
it might not be an effective therapy.  It is crucial to get the dose right for
Warfarin as soon as possible so that it is an effective therapy but mitigates
risk of suffering a bleed.  What you're looking for is the dose size that will
get the concentration of Warfarin in the blood in this "Goldilocks" zone --
not too low, not too high, but just right.  This is the pharmacokinetic part
of Bayesian pharmacokinetics.  Knowing what the body does to the drug
(e.g. absorption, elimination, concentrations, etc.) is called "pharmacokinetics".

In summation, the big question is that given that the drug is highly variable between patients, how do you:

* Best dose someone who just walked into your clinic?  

* Determine if your original dose size was right or wrong as effectively as possible and
course correct?  And, perhaps most importantly,

* Determine how confident you are in your decisions?  After all, you are dealing with someone's life.

The answer to these questions will (hopefully) be the kernel of my thesis.

# Some Basic Pharmacokinetics

In this blog post, I am going to assume that the concentration of drug in the body
at any time is given by

$$ C(t) = \dfrac{D}{V}\dfrac{k_a}{k_a - k}\Big( \exp(-k_at) - \exp(-kt) \Big)\>.$$

Here,

* $D$ is the dose size in milligrams

* $V$ is the volume of the absorptive compartment (think the volume of blood in the body)

* $k$ is the rate at which the drug exists the blood

* $k_a$ is the rate at which the drug is absorbed into the blood

$D$ is under our control, the remaining parameters are unique to an individual.
I'll refer to the set of  $V$, $k$, and $k_a$ as "the pharmacokinetic parameters".

I'll refer to $C(t)$ as the "concentration profile" or "concentration curve" or
"concentration versus time curve".  This function is a solution to a differential
equation which models how the drug is absorbed and eliminated in the body.  The
details of the differential equation are not important.  All we need to know at this
point is that the concentration curve is a function of time and will be different
for different people because different people will have different $V$, $k$, and $k_a$.

Note that now our motivating problem has a slightly different interpretation. If
the pharmacokinetic parameters influence the concentration of a drug, then what we really want to be able
to determine is someone's pharmacokinetic parameters.
