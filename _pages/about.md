# About Demetri

I am a Biostatistics Doctoral Student in The Shulich School of Medicine and Dentistry at The University of Western Ontario.  

My research interests continue to evolve, but one motif that has persisted is the application of mathematics to medical science.  As of late, I have become increasingly interested in computational statistics, Bayesian Methods, and what has begun to be described as Data Science.

In the past, I have worked on topics in mathematical biology.  I am still interested in these topics, but I am not actively participating in any research.

I play chess.
