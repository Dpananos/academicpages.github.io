I'm a Ph.D Candidate in Biostatistics at Western University with a Master's in Applied Mathematics from The University of Waterloo.

My research involves Bayesian methods and machine learning for optimally dosing patients with drugs.  I use a lot of stats and write a lot of code.

I'm a big fan of open source software and reproducible science.  Python and R are like my right and left hands, respectively.

I play a lot of chess.
