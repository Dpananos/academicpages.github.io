I'm a Ph.D student in Biostatistics at Western University.  I earned my Masters of Mathematics in Applied Math from The University of Waterloo in 2016 under the supervision of Chris Bauch.

My research interests surround machine learning and Bayesian methods for personalized medicine.  

I am also affiliated with The Rotman Institute for Philosophy.  While there, I hope to learn more about the philosophy of science as it relates to knowledge generation, especially from a statistical perspective.
