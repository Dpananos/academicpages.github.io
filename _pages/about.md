## Applied Mathematician. Statistician. Scientist
I am a Biostatistics Doctoral Student in The Shulich School of Medicine & Dentistry at The University of Western Ontario.  

My research interests surround the application of mathematics to medical science. Lately, I have become increasingly interested in computational statistics, Bayesian methods, and what has begun to be described as data science.

In the past, I have worked on topics in mathematical biology.  I am still interested in these topics, but I am not actively participating in any research.

I play a lot of chess.
