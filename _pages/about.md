## Applied Mathematician. Statistician. Data Scientist

I'm a Ph.D Candidate in Biostatistics at Western University.  I completed my Master's in Applied Mathematics at The University of Waterloo. 

My research involves Bayesian methods and machine learning for optimally dosing patients with drugs.  

I'm a big fan of open source software and reproducible science.

I play a lot of chess.
