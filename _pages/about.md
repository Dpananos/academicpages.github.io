I'm a Ph.D candidate in Biostatistics at Western University.  My research interests surround machine learning and Bayesian statistics for personalized medicine.

I earned my Masters of Mathematics in Applied Mathematics from The University of Waterloo.

I am a firm believer in open science, interdisciplinary collaboration, and reproducible research.
