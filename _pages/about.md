I'm a Ph.D student in Biostatistics and a member of the Predictive Health Informatics Lab (PHI Lab) at Western University.  My research interests surround machine learning and Bayesian statistics for personalized medicine.  I also have graduate affiliation with The Rotman Institute of Philosophy.

I earned my Masters of Mathematics in Applied Mathematics from The University of Waterloo in 2016 working under the supervision of Professor Chris Bauch.

I am a firm believer in open science, interdisciplinary collaboration, and reproducible research.  If you would like to talk about any of those three things, or about something unrelated, please feel free to contact me.
