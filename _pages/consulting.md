## Who Am I?

I'm presently completing a Ph.D in Biostatistics at Western University.  Throughout my PhD, I had the good fortune to work as a statistical analyst for The Department of Medicine at Western.  In that role I provided a list of services to researching physicians, including:

* Providing statistical expertise in grant writing
* Helping design analysis plans for funded studies
* Helping clean data to prepare for modelling
* Modelling data
* Reporting and interpreting results of modelling, and
* Communication of results to non-expert audiences

If you need help with statistics of any kind, I'm always open to lend a hand.  Please feel free to reach out.

## Pricing

Prices will vary depending on the effort required.  I have special pricing for students and trainees (e.g. medical residents).  If you would like a quote on pricing, please send me an email with your name, what your position is (e.g. student, resident, clinician etc.), and what you'd like some help on.  We can take it from there.
