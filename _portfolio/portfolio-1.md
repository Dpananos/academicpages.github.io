# Introduction

Retail churn is different than most other forms of churn since every transaction could be that customer's last, or one of a long sequence of transactions.  Normally, churn is a classification problem, but I don't think that classification is appropriate for non-contractual cases. By means of example, suppose you run a retail hardware store.  A competitor opens closer to your most loyal customers and thus offers them the benefit of saving time.  Your most loyal customers may churn without showing any signs.  A typical classification algorithm would missclassify these customers, and cost your business in the long run.
